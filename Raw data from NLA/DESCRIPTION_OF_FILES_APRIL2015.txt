Description of raw NLA datafiles and list of known issues: 

CONTEMPDIATOMS.csv --> diatom count data from water column of lakes sampled (in case: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatom)
Characteristics: 
- approximately 10% of lakes re-sampled a 2nd time
- samples come from a single location in each lake
- counts reliable, standard counting up to 500 individuals 
- species level taxonomy (quality controlled) 
- data is in longformat, so each row is a lake by species combination


CONTEMPPHYTO.csv --> phytoplankton abundance data from water column of lakes sampled (in case: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton)
Characteristics:
- approximately 10% of lakes re-sampled a 2nd time
- samples come from a single location in each lake
- note that while diatoms are a type of phytoplankton, the phytoplankton data does NOT include diatoms. 
- discrepancies in taxonomic resolution, unsure of reliability of species-level identifications
- biovolume data is available but questions abound regarding it's trustworthiness (ask Zo or Amanda) 


CONTEMPZOO.csv --> zooplankton COUNT data from water column of lakes sampled (in case: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooplankton)
Characteristics: 
- approximately 10% of lakes re-sampled a 2nd time
- samples come from a single location in each lake
- the 'ABUND' column is actually raw counts (not actual abundance)- we can convert this based on additional data procured from NLA (i.e. volume of water sampled)
- discrepancies in taxonomic resolution, unsure of reliability of species-level identifications
- certain taxa only to order or genus level 
- information on functional/trophic group for some of the taxa (will have to be completed- lit review)


LAKEINFO.csv --> Location data 
Characteristics: 
- includes latitude and longitude, ecoregion, origin (natural or reservoir--> key to consider) amongst other variables
- see "LakesInformation_Sampled_info_20091113.txt" for metadata


LAKEWATERQUAL.csv --> Water chemistry variables --> this is where we will get our stress variables!!!
Characteristics: 
- see "Lake_watqual_info_2091123.txt" for metadata
- "PTL" refers to total phosphorous and is most likely one of the variables we will use to indicate stress on the landscape. 
- Other stress variable options: 
   SECMEAN - Secchi disk depth (water clarity)
   NTL - total nitrogen (nutrient input)
   CHLA - chlorophyll a, measure of productivity (somewhat redundant with PTL and NTL, also relies directly on phytoplankton)
